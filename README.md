# Image-Recognition-using-CNN-and-RNN
The program ask the user to provide the training and testing data file (filename without blank).

The dataset contains gray-scale images of handwritten numbers from zero to nine. There are 42000 labeled images in the training dataset and 28000 images in the testing dataset. Our goal is to recognize the digit using different algorithms and evaluate the accuracy of the result.
